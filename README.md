# ðŸ“½ Oscars Winners Predictions

In this project, we worked as a team of three students to extract, integrate, pre-process and transform data to produce a report answering a research question.  

As Student B, I was tasked with scraping critics' reviews for films that won the Academy Awards or were nominated from 2009 until 2024 as well as their characteristics (director, producer, runtime, cast and crew, etc.) from the website Rotten Tomatoes (URL of the main page : https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)

We ultimately analysed this data to try to better understand what criteria are used to choose an Oscar winner from amongst the nominees.

The contents are organized as follows:
1. "Code" folder:
   a. CIP_Rottentomatoes_COMMENTED_FULL_VERSION which contains the full Python code (parts 1, 2 and 3 below) with detailed comments
   b. CIP_Rottentomatoes_part_1_scraping_and_cleaning which contains only the code for scraping and cleaning the data 
   c. CIP_Rottentomatoes_part_2_enrichment which enriches the data with further calculations and information
   d. CIP_Rottentomatoes_part_3_upload which contains code for uploading the cleaned and enriched data to a database (MariaDB)
   e. "Data" folder to be able to run the code

The resulting data is not contained in the repository because the files were too big.
